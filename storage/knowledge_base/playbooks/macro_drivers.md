# The Three Forces: Liquidity, Rates, and Risk Appetite

**Liquidity** — ease of money creation and availability in markets.  
- **High liquidity:** more capital to allocate → often **crypto↑**.  
- **Low liquidity:** capital retreats to safe assets → often **crypto↓**.

**Interest Rates & Real Yields** — cost of capital and opportunity cost.  
- **Rising real yields:** safer fixed income gets interest → risk assets like crypto may underperform.  
- **Falling/Negative real yields:** risk assets often benefit as holding cash/traditionals yields less.

**Risk Appetite** — investors' willingness to deploy into high-beta assets.  
- **Risk-on:** flows toward equities and crypto.  
- **Risk-off:** flows into bonds, USD, gold; crypto tends to retrace.

**Mental Model:**  
_When liquidity is abundant and real yields are low, capital tends to flow into risk assets like crypto._

# Key Macro Regimes & Crypto Behavior

## 1. **Liquidity Expansion + Low Real Yields**
- Central banks easing or markets pricing cuts.
- Credit growth supportive.
- **Typical crypto behavior:** strong rallies; BTC/ETH lead; alt season often follows.

## 2. **Tightening + Rising Real Yields**
- Rate hikes, QT, higher market funding costs.
- **Typical crypto behavior:** drawdowns; BTC often leads on the downside, alts underperform.

## 3. **Flight to Safety / Risk-Off**
- Macro stress events.
- **Typical crypto behavior:** swift sell-offs; correlation to equities increases.

# Cross‑Asset Relationships

**BTC & Risk Assets**
- BTC often correlates with equities in risk-on regimes.
- BTC can decouple during extreme crypto-specific flows (e.g., exchange liquidity stress).

**ETH & DeFi/Activity Metrics**
- ETH price shows sensitivity to network activity, staking yields, and funding flows.

**Stablecoins**
- Serve as liquidity pivots; flows into stablecoins often signal risk-off rotation within crypto.

# Regime Drivers (Rules of Thumb)

### Liquidity and Risk:
- **Liquidity up + risk appetite up → crypto rallies**
- **Liquidity down + risk aversion up → crypto declines**

### Rates & Opportunity Cost:
- **Real yields rising → crypto under pressure**
- **Real yields falling → crypto supported**

### Macro Signals that Often Coincide with Crypto Moves:
- Yield curve shifts signaling growth concerns.
- Major CPI prints or rate decisions.
- USD strength/weakness affecting global speculative capital.

# Pitfalls & Confirmations

**Key Pitfalls**
- Crypto-specific events can override macro (exchange issues, protocol defaults).
- Narrative-driven flows (halving cycles, ETF flows) can distort macro signals.

**Confirm with**
- Volume and open interest shifts.
- Funding rates across exchanges.
- BTC dominance shifts (indicative of alt vs BTC rotations).

# Mini Glossary

- **Funding Rate:** periodic payments between longs/shorts — high positive suggests crowding.
- **BTC Dominance:** share of BTC in total crypto market cap.
- **Real Yield:** nominal yield adjusted for inflation expectations.
- **Risk‑On / Risk‑Off:** market-wide preference for risk assets vs safe havens.

# Prompt Hints (LLM Retrieval)

- “Explain today’s crypto price move using liquidity + real yields context.”
- “Is BTC outperforming ETH because of macro or crypto structural factors?”
- “What does rising USD and rising real yields imply for crypto in the near term?”
